Then, all the venues were grouped by neighbourhoods, while the mean of the frequency of occurrence of each category was computed. This resulted in a table of results such that any given venue was listed in each row, while each column represented the frequency of occurrence of that particular category. This method of one hot encoding is a method of feature selection.

Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning machine learning algorithm that finds patterns in data without a prediction task in mind (i.e. input data has no labelled responses). Data can be clustered based on the patterns and similarities found in the data. In this case, K-Means clustering was implemented due to its simplistic approach in determining the similarities between neighbourhoods."

    "It is quite evident from the results that clustering algorithm does not segment the neighbourhoods for location areas very well. It may seem as though there is correlation between the geolocation neighbourhoods in both Downtown Toronto and Manhattan as neighbourhoods within Manhattan bare a lot of similarity to neighbourhoods within Downtown Toronto. As previously mentioned there was one cluster that only consisted of one neighbourhood which may indicate its dissimillarity with other neighbourhoods. Upon further research it was found that the top 10 high end neighbourhoods in Manhattan are Soho, Tribeca, Flatiron District, Midtown Mahattan, Hudson Square, West Village, Garment Village, Central Park South, East Village and Chelsea as reported by Investopedia. These top 10 high end neighbourhoods are in the same cluster as some lower end neighbourhoods such as Cental and East Harlem. This would indicate some unreliability in the model as these Manhattan neighbourhoods do not resemble each other which would then also mean there is dissimilarity to those neighbourhoods in Downtown Toronto would not be properly grouped together. This further indicates that the data is not segmented well as there are no distinct groupings and there is a need for more clusters and a revision of the model is necessary.\n",

    "In this project segmentation was performed on neighbourhoods between two different areas of two different countries to discern if an individual were to come from a neighbourhood in Downtown, Toronto and planned to move to Manhattan, which neighbourhoods would best resemble where they currently reside. The data used to answer our research question consisted of location information of venues around the neighbourhoods which was obtained using the Foursquare API. One Hot Encoding is used for converting the categories of the venues into a feature matrix. Subsequently, all venues are grouped by neighbourhoods while the mean is calculated. The resultant features used are the top 10 venues in descending order from most common to least common of 10 of frequency of occurrence from each category in a neighbourhood.\n",
    "In order to find similiraties and dissimilarities between all the neighbourhoods listed in the feature matrix, a machine learning algorithm known as K-Means clustering was used to group and segment the data. The elbow method and the sihlouette score method were both used for determining the most favourable number of clusters. The most optimal \"K\" number of clusters was determined as 2. The results showed that there is one group that contains only one neighbourhood that is isolated from others in its own cluster whilst all other neighbourhoods were grouped into the other cluster. This further indicated that the data did not segment well as there are no distinct groupings and there is a need for more clusters and a revision of the model is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, our research question could not be fully answered as to whether a user who intends to move from Toronto to Manhattan could not be fully explained as the current model suggests that a user who lives anywhere in Downtown Toronto could move to any neighbourhood in Manhattan which is not neccessarily true."
